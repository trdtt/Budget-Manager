### Edit Screen
To ensure a quick and convenient input of new expenses or income, 6 buttons can be assigned to the most frequently

multiple presses of the button will accumulate the values.

### Rename Quick-Buy-Buttons 
If the predefined labels or money amounts are not suitable, users can modify them by long-pressing the respective 
buttons. If the new label is too long to fit on the button, the font size can also be adjusted.
