### Edit Screen
To ensure a quick and convenient input of new expenses or income, six buttons can be assigned to the most frequently 
incomes/expenses. The screenshot displays the default settings for the six buttons. The same principle applies when 
entering the price, where the total price results from clicking on the different values multiple times.

### Rename Quick-Buy-Buttons 
If the predefined labels or money amounts are not suitable, users can modify them by long-pressing the respective 
buttons. If the new label is too long to fit on the button, the font size can also be adjusted.
